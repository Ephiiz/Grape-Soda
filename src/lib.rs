/*
Grape Soda is a general purpose Rust library for common util function I use when making my projects.
Contributions are accepted, so if you want to make improvements, send in a pull request.


Project Structure:
    The library is split into different private crates and the workspace root provides the implementation of the actual library methods, using
    implementations defined in the private crates.
